# CS50X-Problems-Sets
This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets from Harvard University's CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science. Each week focuses on fundamental concepts of computer science, transitioning from visual block-based programming to low-level memory management in C.

🚀 Curriculum Overview
Week 0: Scratch

Focus: Computational Thinking & Logic

Implemented a project using Scratch to understand loops, conditionals, variables, and events.

Key Problem Set: Scratch Project (Interactive animation/game).

Week 1: C

Focus: Syntax, Data Types, and Operators

Introduction to the C programming language, compilers, and the command line.

Key Problem Sets:

Hello: Basic I/O.

Mario: Nested loops for pattern generation.

Cash/Credit: Greedy algorithms and Luhn’s Algorithm for credit card validation.

Week 2: Arrays

Focus: Memory Layout and String Manipulation

Deep dive into how data is stored in contiguous memory blocks.

Key Problem Sets:

Readability: Implementing the Coleman-Liau index to determine text grade levels.

Caesar/Vigenère/Bulb: Cryptography basics using command-line arguments and character shifting.

Week 3: Algorithms

Focus: Efficiency, Sorting, and Searching

Analyzing the time complexity (O notation) of various algorithms.

Key Problem Sets:

Sort: Comparing Selection, Bubble, and Merge sort.

Plurality: Implementing a basic plurality voting system.

Runoff/Tideman: Developing complex electoral systems (Ranked Choice and Condorcet's method).

Week 4: Memory

Focus: Pointers, Hexadecimal, and File I/O

Managing the heap and stack, and understanding how images are stored as byte arrays.
